# ProjectorController9000

The objective of this experiment is to discard the laborious task of manually turning on/off a
projector when delivering presentations on a Raspberry Pi. The approach undertaken to automate
this is to catch HDMI connect/disconnect events and send appropriate signals to the projector
through an IR Transmitter. 

Done as a part of VL 855 - Device Driver Development coursework at IIIT-B.
